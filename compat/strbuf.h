#ifndef STRBUF_H

/*
 * Strbuf's can be use in many ways: as a byte array, or to store arbitrary
 * long, overflow safe strings.
 *
 * Strbufs has some invariants that are very important to keep in mind:
 *
 * 1. the ->buf member is always malloc-ed, hence strbuf's can be used to
 *    build complex strings/buffers whose final size isn't easily known.
 *
 *    It is NOT legal to copy the ->buf pointer away.
 *
 * 2. the ->buf member is a byte array that has at least ->len + 1 bytes
 *    allocated. The extra byte is used to store a '\0', allowing the ->buf
 *    member to be a valid C-string. Every strbuf function ensures this
 *    invariant is preserved.
 *
 *    Note that it is OK to "play" with the buffer directly if you work it
 *    that way:
 *
 *    strbuf_grow(sb, SOME_SIZE);
 *       ... Here, the memory array starting at sb->buf, and of length
 *       ... strbuf_avail(sb) is all yours, and you are sure that
 *       ... strbuf_avail(sb) is at least SOME_SIZE.
 *    strbuf_setlen(sb, sb->len + SOME_OTHER_SIZE);
 *
 *    Doing so is safe, though if it has to be done in many places, adding the
 *    missing API to the strbuf module is the way to go.
 *
 *    XXX: do _not_ assume that the area that is yours is of size ->alloc - 1
 *         even if it's true in the current implementation. Alloc is somehow a
 *         "private" member that should not be messed with.
